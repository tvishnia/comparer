# comparer

Hi! I do my experiments here, so don't be surprised to find out that some parts are not related to each other.

The purpose of this project is to clean up my storages and remove the duplicates. I don't like bit-to-bit comparison as it's rather slow especially if you have a lot of similar files in a lot of places and some of them have names like restored_file_11111.jpg. So, here I search for a best way to clear up this mess.
